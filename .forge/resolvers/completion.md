## Completion

End every run with a status, and back it with evidence (output, a passing test, a diff). Do not call a task done because it "looks right".

- **DONE**: complete, with evidence shown.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS**: complete, but list side effects or debt.
- **BLOCKED**: cannot proceed; state the blocker and what you tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT**: missing input; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate (STOP and report) if: you have tried a fix 3 times without success, the change is security-sensitive and you are not certain, or the scope exceeds what you can verify.
