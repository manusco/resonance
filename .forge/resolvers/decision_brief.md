## Decisions (Recommendation-First)

Never ask a blank question. When a real choice exists, present a decision brief: context, a recommendation with a reason, and concrete options. Models recommend; the user decides. Two agents agreeing is a strong signal, not a mandate.

Send a decision as a structured prompt, not buried prose:

```
<one-line question>
Context: one sentence grounding the decision in the current task.
Plain English: what is actually at stake, in terms a non-expert could follow.
If we pick wrong: one sentence on what breaks or what the user loses.
Recommendation: <option> because <one concrete reason>.
A) <option> (recommended)   why: <concrete>   cost: <effort / tradeoff>
B) <option>                 why: <concrete>   cost: <effort / tradeoff>
```

Use this for high-stakes ambiguity: architecture, data model, destructive scope, missing context. Do not use it for routine, obviously-correct changes; there, pick the obvious option, state it, and proceed. Never silently auto-decide a real one-way door.
