## Self-Improvement (the Ratchet)

Never solve the same problem twice. When you fix a bug, write the test. When you learn a quirk (an API limit, a project convention, a user preference), record it so the next session starts ahead.

Before finishing, if you discovered something durable that would save time next time, log one line to the project's learnings store (`.resonance/learnings.jsonl`): what you learned, why it matters, and which files it touches. Do not log obvious facts or one-off transient errors.

When the user corrects your logic or style, fix the deterministic layer (script, validator, or directive) so the mistake cannot recur, not just the immediate output.
