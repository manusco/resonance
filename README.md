## 👋 Hi. We built this to stop the "Groundhog Day" of prompting.

You know the feeling. You start a new chat. You paste your tech stack. You remind the AI to use TypeScript. You remind it to check for security vulnerabilities. You remind it to write tests.
**And you do it again. And again. And again.**

It’s exhausting. And frankly, it’s a waste of your time.

**Resonance is the cure for repetitive prompting.**

It is a comprehensive **Agentic Operating System** that comes pre-loaded with battle-tested engineering protocols.
*   **Security?** Built-in.
*   **Testing?** Standardized.
*   **Deployment?** One command.

We took the best practices from elite engineering teams and baked them directly into the file system. So you don't have to prompt for quality. You just get it.

## 🚀 How to try it (30 seconds)
The best way to understand it is to see it work.

**1. Clone the Brain**
Pull the framework into your project root.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manusco/resonance .resonance
```

**2. Wake Up the System**
In your IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, etc.), just type:
```bash
@Resonance /init
```

**3. Tell it what you're building**
Resonance will ask you: *"What are we building?"*
Be honest. Tell it your vision. It will listen, thinking about the architecture, and then write it down in `00_soul.md`. 
From that moment on, it never forgets.

## ⚡ The Superpower: Battle-Tested Protocols
Most AI frameworks just give you "tools". We give you **Standards**.
Resonance contains a library of rigorous protocols (in `.agent/skills`) that enforce quality automatically.

### 🛡️ Security is not optional
When you run `/audit`, you aren't just asking the AI to "look for bugs". You are triggering the **Security Auditor**, which runs a 50-point inspection based on OWASP standards. It checks for JWT vulnerabilities, injection risks, and header configurations.
> *You don't have to remember to ask for security. The system remembers for you.*

### 🚢 Shipping is not a guess
When you run `/ship`, you trigger the **Release Protocol**.
It doesn't just push code. It:
1.  Runs the health check.
2.  Updates the `CHANGELOG.md`.
3.  Bumps the version.
4.  Tags the release.
> *It turns a stressful deployment into a boring checklist.*

### 🏗️ Architecture is not a vibe
When you run `/plan`, the **Architect** doesn't just guess. It references your `00_soul.md` (Vision) and `04_systems.md` (Architecture) to ensure every new feature aligns with the whole.

## 👩‍🚀 The Engineering Team (26 Specialists)
You wouldn't ask a backend engineer to design your logo. So why ask a generic chatbot to do everything?
Resonance comes with **26 Specialized Personas**. These are deep, codified identities that know exactly how to do their specific job.

*   **The Venture Validator**: Before you build, it models the revenue math and checks for "Kill Criteria".
*   **The Glasssmith**: Our Frontend expert. It interacts with "Touch Physics" and visual hierarchy, not just CSS classes.
*   **The Friction Physicist**: A unique agent that simulates user "Drag" (latency, confusion) and eliminates it.

You don't have to teach them how to do their job. They already know.

## 🧩 The Second Brain (`.resonance/`)
This is the engine that makes it all possible. A structured "Second Brain" that lives in your repo.

| The Cortex | File | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Soul** | `00_soul.md` | **The Constitution**. Your Vision, Mission, and User Persona. Even if you change LLMs, the Soul remains. "Who are we building for?" |
| **The State** | `01_state.md` | **The RAM**. What is the *active* task? What was the last decision? This prevents the "What was I doing?" loop. |
| **The Memory** | `02_memory.md` | **The Hard Drive**. A permanent audit log of architectural decisions (ADRs). We never solve the same problem twice. |
| **The Map** | `04_systems.md` | **The Blueprint**. Logic flows, database schemas, and API contracts. The LLM reads this *before* it writes a line of code. |

## 💙 Why we built this
We believe that software engineering is a craft.
It shouldn't be a slot machine where you pull the lever (prompt) and hope for a jackpot (working code).

It should be:
1.  **Intentional**: You define the Soul.
2.  **Persistent**: The system remembers.
3.  **Standardized**: The protocols protect you.

Resonance is just a set of files in your folder. But it's also a collection of the best engineering practices, ready to work for you.
We are proud of what we've built. We hope it helps you build something amazing.

**Happy Building.**
