**Resonance** is an Agentic Operating System. It gives your AI agent persistent memory, elite specialist skills, and scientific workflows—all stored right in your repo.

## 🛑 The Problem: "The Amnesia Loop"
Most AI agents are brilliant but suffer from severe short-term memory loss.
*   ❌ They don't know your architecture.
*   ❌ They forget your coding style.
*   ❌ They hallucinate solutions you already rejected.
*   ❌ They are "Tourists" in your codebase.

## ⚡ The Solution: "Local-First God Mode"
Resonance installs a brain into your project root (`.resonance/`). It remembers everything.
1.  **Soul (`00_soul.md`)**: Your Vision and Non-negotiables.
2.  **State (`01_state.md`)**: The current context of the project.
3.  **Memory (`02_memory.md`)**: A log of lessons learned (The "Black Box").

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED (5 Seconds)

### Option A: The Fresh Start (New Project)
Use this repo as a template to launch a new, elite project.
```bash
# 1. Clone the Resonance OS
git clone https://github.com/manusco/resonance my-new-app

# 2. Wake up the system
cd my-new-app
./resonance.sh
```

### Option B: The Brain Transplant (Existing Project)
Inject Resonance into a repo you already have.
```bash
# 1. Copy the brain and skills to your root
cp -r /path/to/resonance/.resonance ./
cp -r /path/to/resonance/.agent ./
cp resonance.sh ./

# 2. Wake up the system
./resonance.sh
```

## 🛠️ WHAT ARE YOU BUILDING TODAY? (Jobs to be Done)
Don't just "chat" with the AI. **Command it.** Use these Slash Commands to trigger elite workflows.

| I want to... | The Command | The Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Start a new feature/idea"** | `/init_project` | **The Launchpad.** Kills bad ideas. Validates specs. Drafts the PRD. |
| **"Make it look world-class"** | `/design_ui` | **The Visual Engine.** Enforces design systems. "No ugly pixels allowed." |
| **"Build the damn thing"** | `/plan_execution` | **The Tactician.** atomic steps. "Think before you code." |
| **"Fix a weird bug"** | `/debug_issue` | **The Sherlock Protocol.** Scientific debugging. "No fix without root cause." |
| **"Clean up my code"** | `/refactor_code` | **The Architect.** Structural refinement. "Make it readable." |
| **"Ship to production"** | `/deploy_project` | **ShipIt.** Audits, builds, and optimizes. |

## 🕶️ MEET YOUR SQUAD (The Specialists)
Resonance doesn't just "help." It assigns a **Google-tier Specialist** to every task.

| Specialist | Role | The "Prompt Injection" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`resonance-product`** | Product Manager | *"Write the Press Release before the code."* |
| **`resonance-architect`** | System Architect | *"No magic. Hard decisions written down."* |
| **`resonance-qa`** | QA Engineer | *"Break it before the user does."* |
| **`resonance-frontend`** | UX Engineer | *"If it's not beautiful, it's a bug."* |
| **`resonance-security`** | Security Auditor | *"Trust nothing. Verify everything."* |
| ...and 15 more | full stack | Fully loaded in `.agent/skills`. |

## 🖤 PHILOSOPHY: "Elite or Nothing"
We believe that AI should not just "generate code". It should **engineer systems**.

*   **We believe in "Working Backwards":** Write the docs before the code.
*   **We believe in "Visual Excellence":** "Good enough" is not enough.
*   **We believe in empowering everyone:** You don't need a $500k team. You just need Resonance.

**Welcome to the new standard.**
