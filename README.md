## 👋 Hi. We built this to stop the "Groundhog Day" of prompting.

You know the feeling. You start a new chat. You paste your tech stack. You remind the AI to use TypeScript. You remind it to check for security vulnerabilities. You remind it to write tests.
**And you do it again. And again. And again.**

It’s exhausting. And frankly, it’s a waste of your time.

**Resonance is the cure for repetitive prompting.**

It is a comprehensive **Agentic Operating System** that comes pre-loaded with battle-tested engineering protocols.
*   **Security?** Built-in.
*   **Testing?** Standardized.
*   **Deployment?** One command.

We took the best practices from elite engineering teams and baked them directly into the file system. So you don't have to prompt for quality. You just get it.

## 🚀 How to try it (30 seconds)
The best way to understand it is to see it work.

**1. Clone the Brain**
Pull the framework into your project root.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manusco/resonance .resonance
```

**2. Wake Up the System**
In your IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, etc.), just type:
```bash
@Resonance /init
```

**3. Tell it what you're building**
Resonance will ask you: *"What are we building?"*
Be honest. Tell it your vision. It will listen, thinking about the architecture, and then write it down in `00_soul.md`. 
From that moment on, it never forgets.

## ⚡ The Workflow Library (Token-Efficient Intelligence)
Resonance workflows are not just "prompts". They are structured algorithms designed to save tokens and time. 
We stripped away the fluff. Each workflow is a **templatized, rigorous protocol** that gets straight to the point.

### 🟡 Strategy & Inception
*   **`/venture-model`**: **Business Logic**. Validates the business model, offer, and revenue math before you build.
*   **`/plan`**: **The Architect**. Reads 80% of the time. Writes 20%. Generates a detailed `implementation_plan.md` to prevent "hallucinated scope".
*   **`/update-roadmap`**: **State Sync**. Keeps your `01_state.md` aligned with reality.

### 🟢 Execution & Engineering
*   **`/build`**: **The Builder**. Runs the TDD Loop (Red -> Green -> Refactor).
*   **`/debug`**: **The Scientist**. Forces Root Cause Analysis (RCA) with reproduction scripts. No guessing allowed.
*   **`/refactor`**: **The Essentialist**. Cleans up technical debt without changing behavior.
*   **`/design`**: **The Glasssmith**. Generates premium, "Touch Physics" UI components.

### 🔵 Quality & Verification
*   **`/audit`**: **The Swarm**. Runs a 50-point Security (OWASP), Performance, and Lint check.
*   **`/test`**: **The Pyramid**. Generates Unit, Integration, and E2E tests.
*   **`/friction`**: **The Collider**. Simulates a user journey to find and remove "Drag" (latency, confusion).
*   **`/seo`**: **The Growth Engine**. Optimizes for Search and Answer Engines (GEO).

### 🟣 Operations & Delivery
*   **`/ship`**: **The Ritual**. Updates Changelog, bumps version, checks health, and deploys.
*   **`/capture`**: **The Librarian**. Documents solved problems so you never solve them twice.
*   **`/system-health`**: **Self-Repair**. Checks the integrity of the Resonance system itself.

> **Why this matters**: You don't pay for the AI to "think" about how to be a security auditor. We already taught it. You only pay for the work.

## 👩‍🚀 The Engineering Team (26 Specialists)
You wouldn't ask a backend engineer to design your logo. So why ask a generic chatbot to do everything?
Resonance comes with **26 Specialized Personas**. These are deep, codified identities that know exactly how to do their specific job.

*   **The Venture Validator**: Before you build, it models the revenue math and checks for "Kill Criteria".
*   **The Glasssmith**: Our Frontend expert. It interacts with "Touch Physics" and visual hierarchy, not just CSS classes.
*   **The Friction Physicist**: A unique agent that simulates user "Drag" (latency, confusion) and eliminates it.

You don't have to teach them how to do their job. They already know.

## 🧩 The Second Brain (`.resonance/`)
This is the engine that makes it all possible. A structured "Second Brain" that lives in your repo.

| The Cortex | File | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Soul** | `00_soul.md` | **The Constitution**. Your Vision, Mission, and User Persona. Even if you change LLMs, the Soul remains. "Who are we building for?" |
| **The State** | `01_state.md` | **The RAM**. What is the *active* task? What was the last decision? This prevents the "What was I doing?" loop. |
| **The Memory** | `02_memory.md` | **The Hard Drive**. A permanent audit log of architectural decisions (ADRs). We never solve the same problem twice. |
| **The Map** | `04_systems.md` | **The Blueprint**. Logic flows, database schemas, and API contracts. The LLM reads this *before* it writes a line of code. |

## 💙 Why we built this
We believe that software engineering is a craft.
It shouldn't be a slot machine where you pull the lever (prompt) and hope for a jackpot (working code).

It should be:
1.  **Intentional**: You define the Soul.
2.  **Persistent**: The system remembers.
3.  **Standardized**: The protocols protect you.

Resonance is just a set of files in your folder. But it's also a collection of the best engineering practices, ready to work for you.
We are proud of what we've built. We hope it helps you build something amazing.

**Happy Building.**
