**Resonance** is an Agentic Operating System. It gives your AI agent persistent memory, elite specialist skills, and scientific workflows—all stored right in your repo.

## 🛑 The Problem: "The Amnesia Loop"
Most AI agents are brilliant but suffer from severe short-term memory loss.
*   ❌ They don't know your architecture.
*   ❌ They forget your coding style.
*   ❌ They hallucinate solutions you already rejected.
*   ❌ They are "Tourists" in your codebase.

## ⚡ The Solution: "Local-First God Mode"
Resonance installs a brain into your project root (`.resonance/`). It remembers everything.
*   **Soul (`00_soul.md`)**: Your Vision and Non-negotiables.
*   **State (`01_state.md`)**: The current context of the project.
*   **Memory (`02_memory.md`)**: A log of lessons learned (The "Black Box").

> *"Stop coding with a goldfish. Start coding with a Grandmaster."*

## 🕶️ The Elite Specialists
We don't settle for "average" assistance. Resonance brings Google-tier engineering roles to your local environment.

| Specialist | Superpower | The Prompt Injection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`resonance-product`** | **Working Backwards** | *"Write the Press Release before the code."* |
| **`resonance-architect`** | **C4 & ADRs** | *"No magic. Hard decisions written down."* |
| **`resonance-qa`** | **Destructive Inversion** | *"Break it before they do."* |
| **`resonance-core`** | **State Management** | *"I am the consciousness of this project."* |
| **`resonance-devops`** | **GitOps & IaC** | *"Git is Truth. Servers are Cattle."* |
| ...and 12 more | (Security, Growth, etc.) | Fully loaded in `.agent/skills`. |

## 🧪 The "Scientific" Workflows
Don't just "ask" the AI. **Run a Protocol.**

### 1. `/init_project` ("The Launchpad")
> *From "I have an idea" to "Validated Spec"*
*   Activates `resonance-venture` to kill bad ideas.
*   Activates `resonance-product` to draft a Press Release.

### 2. `/design_system` ("The Blueprint")
> *From Spec to Architecture*
*   Activates `resonance-researcher` to find trade-offs.
*   Activates `resonance-architect` to build C4 Diagrams.

### 3. `/plan_execution` ("The Tactician")
> *From Design to Tasks*
*   Breaks down work into atomic, verifiable steps.
*   Enforces the "Ralph Loop" (Repro -> Fix -> Verify).

### 4. `/system_audit` ("The Doctor")
> *A full MRI for your code*
*   Checks Security, Stability, and Freshness.
*   Assigns a Health Score (0-100).

## 🖤 Philosophy: "Elite or Nothing"
We believe that AI should not just "generate code". It should **engineer systems**.
**We believe in empowering everyone, not just those who can pay.**
Resonance forces the AI to think before it acts, creating software that survives.

**Welcome to the new standard.**
