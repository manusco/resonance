# Contributing

We built Resonance to help us write better software.
It is not perfect. It never will be.
But with your help, it can be useful.

## How to Help

You don't need permission.
If you see a typo, fix it.
If you know a better way to test React components, write a skill.
If a workflow is broken, tell us.

### Adding a Skill

1.  **Look around**. Check `.agent/skills/` to see how we do things.
2.  **Copy and paste**. Take an existing skill that looks like what you want.
3.  **Make it yours**. Rewrite the instructions. Be specific.
4.  **Test it**. Run it against a real problem. If it fails, fix it.

### Adding a Workflow

1.  **Keep it simple**. Workflows are just markdown files in `.agent/workflows/`.
2.  **Solve one problem**. Don't try to solve everything.
3.  **Use the Interview**. Ask the user what they need. Don't guess.

## The Standard

We have a few rules.
They keep the system sane.

*   **Test everything**. If you can't verify it, don't ship it.
*   **Write for humans**. Code is for machines. Comments and docs are for people.
*   **Be kind**. We are all learning.

That's it.
Thank you for contributing!
Happy building!
