description: Convert Architecture into Atomic, Verifiable Steps (Implementation Plan).
---

# Workflow: Plan Execution ("The Tactician")

**Trigger**: "Start coding", "Implement this feature".
**Context**: You have a goal, now you need a roadmap.

## 1. Decomposition (The Slicer)
*Activate Skill*: `resonance-architect`

- [ ] **Breakdown**: Split the feature into Atomic Tasks (< 2 hours).
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Identify blockers (e.g., "Need DB schema before API").

## 2. The Plan (The Map)
- [ ] **Create Artifact**: Write `implementation_plan.md`.
- [ ] **Structure**:
    *   **Proposed Changes**: File by file.
    *   **Verification**: How will we prove it works? (Test command).
    *   **Risk**: What could go wrong?

## 3. Review (The Sanity Check)
*Activate Skill*: `resonance-reviewer`

- [ ] **Critique**: Is this plan too complex? Can we simplify?
- [ ] **Approve**: Ask User for "Go/No-Go".

## 4. Task State
- [ ] **Update**: Write the plan into `task.md` (or use the Task tool).
